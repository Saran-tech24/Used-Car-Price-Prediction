# Used-Car-Price-Prediction

## Objective:

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the prices of used cars based on features like make, model, year, fuel type, and more. This model will be deployed as a Streamlit web application for customer and sales representative use.

**Skills Acquired:**

1.Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2.Machine Learning Model Development and Deployment

3.Streamlit Application Development

4.Model Evaluation and Optimization

## Approach:

**Data Processing:**

1.Merge multiple city datasets into one.

2.Handle missing values, standardize formats, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

3.Remove outliers to avoid skewing the model.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

1.Use visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps) and statistical summaries to understand data patterns.

2.Perform feature selection to identify key factors affecting car prices.

**Model Development:**

1.Train-test split the data (e.g., 80-20).
2.Train models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
3.Apply hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

**Model Evaluation:**

1.Use performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared.

2.Compare models to select the best one.

**Deployment:**

1.Build a user-friendly Streamlit app for real-time car price prediction.

2.Allow users to input car features and view predicted prices instantly.
